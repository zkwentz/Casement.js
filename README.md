Casement.js
========

A lightweight, responsive jQuery plugin for resizable window "panes".

The goal of Casement is to be responsive. All of the jQuery plugins I found that performed this function set widths and offsets in absolute pixels, which doesn't work when the viewport is resized. Casement solves that.


## Example ##

    $('.casement').casement();


## The options: ##

* None, for now
